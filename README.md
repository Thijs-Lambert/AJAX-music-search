# AJAX-music-search

### Overview
The learning objective for the exercise is to make use of AJAX (asynchronous javascript) to fetch- and display data and you'll create a simple youtube clone with data from this [API](https://musicdemons.com/api).

### Objectives
There's **two main user stories** to this app:

* A user can search for artists by name and they are displayed as a list so the user can see the search result
* A user can click a search result item and it displays a list of related youtube videos for the user to watch/listen

#### Search Artists

#### How to get started

Start with the provided boilerplate. The boilerplate has a JS folder which contains a `script.js` that has pre-made functions for the foundations of the project and guiding you in the right direction. And also a css folder with some basic styling to get you started.

### Completion checklist

- [ ] Create an autocomplete search with your AJAX knowledge
- [ ] Display the autocomplete options in a clickable list
- [ ] Allow the user to select an artist
- [ ] Fetch and display the available youtube videos for the selected artist
- [ ] Optional: using the YouTube player API display the lyrics of the song that is playing
