# AJAX-music-search

### Overview
The learning objective for the exercise is to make use of AJAX to fetch- and display data and we'll create a simple youtube clone with this [API](https://musicdemons.com/api).

### Objectives
There's **two main user stories** to this app:

* A user can search for artists by name and they are displayed as a list so the user can see the search result
* A user can click a search result item and it displays a list of related youtube videos for the user to watch/listen
